# Huarongdao (华容道）solver

Huarongdao is a Chinese variation of Klotski ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klotski)),
a sliding block puzzle thought to have originated in the early 20th century. 

This is a game I played on a plane for hours and hours but couldn't figure it out. So I wrote a simple program on the plane to solve it. Right now
it just uses brute force, but this puzzle can be formulated as an MDP and solved by reinforcement learning.
